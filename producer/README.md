Here’s 
a list of all the key topics you should be familiar with when using **RabbitMQ** with **NestJS** at an intermediate level:

### 1. **Basic RabbitMQ Concepts**
   - Message Broker
   - Producer
   - Consumer
   - Queue
   - Exchange
   - Binding

### 2. **RabbitMQ with NestJS (Using NestJS Microservices)**
   - Setting up RabbitMQ with NestJS
   - `ClientsModule` for RabbitMQ configuration
   - `ClientProxy` for emitting events to RabbitMQ
   - `@EventPattern` decorator for listening to events
   - Emit and Send patterns
     - `emit` for fire-and-forget events
     - `send` for request-response messaging
   - Configuring `MicroserviceOptions` with `Transport.RMQ`

### 3. **Queues and Exchanges**
   - Direct Exchange
   - Fanout Exchange
   - Topic Exchange
   - Headers Exchange

### 4. **Durability, Acknowledgments, and Persistence**
   - Durable Queues (`durable: true`)
   - Persistent Messages (`persistent: true`)
   - Message Acknowledgments (`ack: true`)
   - Pre-fetch Limit

### 5. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms**
   - Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX)
   - Retry Mechanisms for failed messages
   - Error Handling in Consumers and Producers

### 6. **Multiple Queues and Exchanges**
   - Managing Multiple Queues in a Single Application
   - Routing Messages to Different Queues
   - Binding Queues to Exchanges

### 7. **Communication Patterns in RabbitMQ**
   - Event-Driven Architecture
   - Request-Response Pattern (`client.send()`)
   - Fire-and-Forget Pattern (`client.emit()`)

### 8. **Load Balancing and Scalability**
   - Consumer Scaling
   - Round-Robin Dispatching
   - Fair Dispatch with Prefetch

### 9. **Security and Authentication**
   - User Authentication and Custom Credentials
   - TLS/SSL Encryption for RabbitMQ
   - Role-Based Permissions in RabbitMQ

### 10. **Testing and Monitoring**
   - Testing RabbitMQ-related features in NestJS
   - Monitoring RabbitMQ with Management UI
   - Integrating Monitoring Tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Health Checks for RabbitMQ Connection
