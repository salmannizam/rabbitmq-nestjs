### 7. **Communication Patterns in RabbitMQ**

RabbitMQ allows for several communication patterns that help manage how services interact with one another. Understanding these patterns can help you design scalable, efficient, and decoupled systems like your **rail booking system**. Let's explore three key patterns: **Event-Driven Architecture**, **Request-Response**, and **Fire-and-Forget**.

---

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture**

**Event-Driven Architecture** is a design pattern in which services communicate asynchronously through events. In this pattern:
- **Producers** emit events when something happens.
- **Consumers** listen for and react to those events.

In **RabbitMQ**, an event is represented by a **message** sent to an **exchange**, and **consumers** (services) can subscribe to those events by binding to the appropriate queues.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Loose coupling**: Producers and consumers don't need to know about each other's existence.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently since events are asynchronous.
- **Flexibility**: New services can subscribe to events without modifying existing code.

#### Use Case in Your Rail Booking System:
- **Ticket Booking**: When a user books a ticket, the booking service can emit an event like `booking.created`, which can be consumed by multiple services (e.g., a notification service to notify the user and a reporting service to log the booking).

#### Example in NestJS (Event-Driven Architecture):

##### Producer (Emitting an Event):
```typescript
this.client.emit('booking.created', { bookingId: 123, userId: 456 });
```

##### Consumer (Listening for the Event):
```typescript
@EventPattern('booking.created')
async handleBookingCreated(data: any) {
  console.log('New booking created:', data);
  // Send notification, log the booking, etc.
}
```

In this setup, multiple consumers can listen to the `booking.created` event, and each can perform its task (e.g., send confirmation emails, update reports, etc.).

### 2. **Request-Response Pattern (`client.send()`)**

The **Request-Response Pattern** is a **synchronous** pattern where a service (producer) sends a message to RabbitMQ and **waits for a response** from another service (consumer). This is similar to making a remote procedure call (RPC) but using RabbitMQ as the intermediary.

#### How It Works:
- The producer sends a message and expects a **direct response**.
- The consumer processes the message and returns a result.
- This pattern is useful when the producer needs an **immediate result** before it can continue.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Synchronous flow**: The producer waits for the consumer’s response before proceeding.
- **Immediate feedback**: Useful when a task (like checking a balance or booking a ticket) needs to confirm success or failure right away.

#### Use Case in Your Rail Booking System:
- **Balance Check and Block**: When booking a ticket, the IRCTC service may need to check and block the balance using the **transaction service**. The IRCTC service can send a message requesting to check/block the balance and **wait for a response**.

#### Example in NestJS (Request-Response Pattern):

##### Producer (Sending a Request):
```typescript
async checkAndBlockBalance(userId: string, amount: number) {
  const response = await this.client.send('balance.check_and_block', { userId, amount }).toPromise();
  return response; // Await the response from the consumer
}
```

##### Consumer (Responding to the Request):
```typescript
@MessagePattern('balance.check_and_block')
async handleCheckAndBlock(data: { userId: string, amount: number }) {
  const balanceSufficient = await this.checkBalance(data.userId, data.amount);
  
  if (balanceSufficient) {
    await this.blockBalance(data.userId, data.amount);
    return { success: true };
  } else {
    return { success: false, message: 'Insufficient balance' };
  }
}
```

In this case, the **producer** (IRCTC service) waits for the **consumer** (transaction service) to check and block the balance, and then proceeds based on the result.

### 3. **Fire-and-Forget Pattern (`client.emit()`)**

The **Fire-and-Forget Pattern** is an **asynchronous** pattern where a service (producer) sends a message to RabbitMQ and **doesn’t wait for a response**. The producer assumes the consumer will process the message at some point but doesn't need to wait for confirmation.

#### How It Works:
- The producer emits the message to RabbitMQ and immediately moves on to the next task.
- The consumer processes the message when it’s ready.
- This pattern is useful when the producer doesn’t need immediate feedback or when the task can be handled in the background.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Decoupling**: Producers don't wait for consumers, reducing dependencies.
- **Performance**: Faster than request-response because the producer doesn’t need to wait.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently.

#### Use Case in Your Rail Booking System:
- **Notifications**: After a ticket is booked, you can use the **fire-and-forget** pattern to send a message to the notification service to email or SMS the user. The booking service doesn't need to wait for confirmation that the notification was sent.

#### Example in NestJS (Fire-and-Forget Pattern):

##### Producer (Emitting the Event):
```typescript
this.client.emit('notification.send', { userId: 456, message: 'Your ticket is booked!' });
```

##### Consumer (Handling the Event):
```typescript
@EventPattern('notification.send')
async handleNotification(data: any) {
  console.log('Sending notification to user:', data.userId);
  // Send email or SMS here
}
```

In this pattern, the **producer** sends the message to RabbitMQ and doesn’t wait for the consumer to complete the task. The notification service processes the message in the background.

---

### Summary of Communication Patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Producers emit events, and consumers listen and react to those events.
   - **Use case**: Decoupled systems where multiple services need to react to the same event (e.g., booking, logging, notifications).

2. **Request-Response Pattern (`client.send()`)**:
   - The producer sends a message and waits for a response from the consumer.
   - **Use case**: Synchronous tasks where the producer needs an immediate response (e.g., checking and blocking balance).

3. **Fire-and-Forget Pattern (`client.emit()`)**:
   - The producer emits a message and doesn’t wait for a response.
   - **Use case**: Asynchronous tasks where the producer doesn’t need feedback (e.g., sending notifications).

---

### Choosing the Right Pattern:

- **Event-Driven Architecture** is great for handling events where multiple services need to react to a single event (e.g., booking events, notifications).
- **Request-Response** is essential for synchronous tasks that require confirmation or data from another service (e.g., checking a user’s balance before booking a ticket).
- **Fire-and-Forget** is ideal for tasks where you don’t need a response, such as background processing or notifications.

Each pattern serves different use cases, and RabbitMQ allows you to mix and match these patterns to build a scalable, reliable, and decoupled system.
